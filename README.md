 where I worked on a house price prediction project using Linear Regression. This task involved developing a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on continuous target variables.
🔍 Project Highlights:
Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Development: Implemented a simple linear regression model to predict house prices.
Performance Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Predictions: Generated predictions on the test dataset.
Visualization: Created visualizations to show the regression line and compare actual vs. predicted values, providing insights into the model's accuracy.
📊 Key Insights:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluated the average squared difference between actual and predicted house prices.
R-squared: Determined how well the independent variables explain the variance in house prices.
🚀 This project enhanced my skills in predictive modeling, data splitting, model training, and performance evaluation. It was fascinating to visualize the regression line and see the accuracy of predictions compared to actual values.
